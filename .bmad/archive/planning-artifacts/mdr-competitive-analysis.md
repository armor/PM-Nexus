### 4.2 Critical Gaps

#### Gap 1: Performance Metrics & SLAs (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Armor lacks published MTTD/MTTR benchmarks

**Competitor Benchmarks:**
- CrowdStrike: 4-minute MTTD, 75% MTTR reduction
- Huntress: 8-minute MTTR
- Sophos: 38-minute response time
- eSentire: 15-minute Mean Time to Contain

**Impact:** Cannot compete on outcome-based SLAs, key buying criteria per Gartner

**Recommendation:** Implement real-time performance tracking with published SLA guarantees

---

#### Gap 2: Agentic AI Automation (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Armor has AI assistance but not autonomous investigation/response

**Competitor Capabilities:**
- CrowdStrike: AI-driven operations across incident lifecycle
- eSentire: Multi-agent AI at machine speed
- Ontinue: Sub-60-second autonomous containment
- Expel: Ruxie AI triages millions of events automatically

**Impact:** Missing the primary 2025-2026 market differentiator

**Recommendation:** Develop agentic AI that autonomously triages, investigates, and contains threats with human oversight

---

#### Gap 3: Breach Warranty Program (MEDIUM)

**Issue:** No breach warranty offering

**Competitor Offerings:**
- CrowdStrike: $1M warranty included
- SentinelOne: $1M warranty with Wayfinder MDR

**Impact:** Missing risk-transfer value proposition for CFOs

**Recommendation:** Partner with cyber insurance to offer $500K-$1M warranty

---

#### Gap 4: Identity & SaaS Application Coverage (HIGH)

**Issue:** Limited identity provider and SaaS app monitoring

**Market Requirement:** Per Gartner 2025, MDR must extend beyond endpoints to:

- IaaS platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

**Competitor Coverage:**
- All top providers offer comprehensive identity/SaaS monitoring
- Red Canary/Zscaler: Deep identity-first approach
- Expel: API-based coverage across 350+ integrations

**Recommendation:** Expand detection coverage to major identity providers and business-critical SaaS apps

---

#### Gap 5: Third-Party Integration Breadth (MEDIUM)

**Issue:** Moderate integration count vs 350+ for leaders

**Recommendation:** Aggressive integration expansion, prioritizing:
1. Microsoft ecosystem (Sentinel, Defender XDR, Entra ID)
2. Identity providers (Okta, Ping, CyberArk)
3. ITSM (ServiceNow, Jira)
4. Cloud platforms (expanded AWS, Azure, GCP)
