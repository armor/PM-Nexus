## 1. Executive Summary

Nexus UI Uplift is a platform-wide initiative to make Nexus **GTM-ready and capable of fully replacing AMP** as Armor's primary customer platform by the end of Q1.

This initiative focuses on **stability, consistency, usability, and enterprise-grade presentation**, ensuring Nexus clearly communicates security risk, compliance posture, and Armor-delivered value to both operational users and executives.

Nexus UI Uplift directly supports the **planned AMP sunset**, with success defined by **AMP usage dropping to zero by the end of Q1**. **Product owns Nexus readiness and execution of the AMP sunset.**

This initiative improves usability, interpretability, visual credibility, and metric clarity across Nexus, enabling confident customer adoption, effective demos, and executive-level decision-making. It does not introduce new security detection, prevention, or SOC capabilities, nor does it require major backend or architectural refactors.

## 2. Vision and North Star

The north star for Nexus UI Uplift is that **Nexus functions as the single, trusted platform customers rely on daily**, replacing AMP without loss of capability, clarity, or confidence.

This means:

- Nexus must be stable, predictable, and usable at scale

- Metrics must be explainable, consistent, and defensible

- Executive-level value must be immediately visible

- Operational detail must roll up cleanly into business outcomes

- The platform must look and behave like an enterprise product

- Nexus must communicate **outcomes and value**, not just activity

Nexus is the system of record that proves Armor's value and supports renewals, upsell, and executive trust.

## 3. Problem Statement

Nexus currently exhibits inconsistent navigation, fragmented interactions, unclear metric context, and visual maturity that reflects an MVP rather than an enterprise platform.

These issues reduce usability for operational users and prevent executives from quickly answering fundamental questions about risk posture, trend direction, and value delivered. As a result, customers continue to rely on AMP or human explanation to bridge gaps Nexus should address directly.

With AMP scheduled for sunset in Q1, any lack of readiness, clarity, or stability in Nexus presents material risk to customer adoption, confidence, and renewals. Without a focused, platform-wide uplift prioritizing readiness and trust, Nexus cannot fully assume its role as Armor's primary customer platform.

## 4. Objectives

The objectives of Nexus UI Uplift are to:

- Make Nexus GTM-ready and capable of fully replacing AMP

- Establish Nexus as the trusted system of record for security risk and value

- Enable executives to quickly understand ROI, risk posture, and outcomes

- Ensure platform-wide consistency in behavior, navigation, and components

- Improve usability so customers can self-serve without guidance

- Support AMP sunset with equal or greater value delivered in Nexus

- Align Nexus presentation with Armor's enterprise positioning

- Support renewals and upsell by clearly communicating value

## 5. Scope

### In Scope (Q1)

- Platform stability and removal of high-severity UX and functional bugs

- Navigation consistency and predictable routing

- Standardized component usage and interaction patterns

- Usability improvements across core Nexus workflows

- Executive-friendly metrics and value communication

- Look and feel updates aligned with Armor's enterprise brand

- Metric clarity, definitions, and context (not net-new analytics)

- **Fully functional demo accounts with guardrails** to ensure predictable, high-quality demo experiences

**Standardized sales demo environments**, limited to:

- AEC/AA + MDR (two demo accounts)

- Free AA (two demo accounts)

- Guardrails and constraints to prevent demo users from encountering broken, incomplete, or unexpected platform behavior

### Out of Scope (Q1)

- New security detection, prevention, or SOC capabilities

- Major backend or architectural refactors

- Net-new data sources

- Fully customizable reporting or AI-driven UX

- Deep automation or action frameworks

## 6. Phasing

- **Q1 (Commitment):** Nexus readiness, stability, consistency, usability, AMP sunset

- **Post-Q1:** Enhanced decision intelligence, scoring refinement, customization, and advanced workflows

## 7. Success Criteria

- **Primary:** AMP usage drops to zero by end of Q1

**Secondary:**

- Nexus achieves full functional parity with AMP for all customer-facing workflows

- Demo accounts are fully functional and safe for repeated sales and executive demos

- Nexus becomes the default platform for customers

- Sales and CS can demo Nexus without scripts

- Reduced dependency on AMP and support explanations
